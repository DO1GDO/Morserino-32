# Morserino-32
Morserino-32 multi-functional Morse code machine, based on ESP32

The "**source**" directory contains the program sources (you need an Arduino IDE with the necessary hardware definitions for the heltec module if you want to compile the source).

The "**binary**" directory contains the compiled code in binary format, ready for upload to the Morserino-32 via WiFi (see User Manual for instructions).
