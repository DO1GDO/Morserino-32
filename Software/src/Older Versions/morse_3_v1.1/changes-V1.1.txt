Changes V1.1

Corrected errors:
- Tone shift did not work as stated in the manual (did not work at all): fixed
- File pointer was not reset to beginning of file after upload of a new file, so file player would start somewhere in the middle of the file: fixed
- Battery indicator only worked when waking up from deep sleep; when turning battery on, it always showed something unreliable (usually „battery full“): fixed.

New features:
- New parameter „Latency“ : defines, how long after generating the current element (dot or dash) the paddles will be „deaf“. This always used to be 0, with the effect, that especially at higher speeds you would generate more dots than intended, as you had to release the paddle while the last dot was still „on“. Now you can set this to a value between 0 and 7, meaning 0/8 to 7/8 of a dot length (default is 4, i.e. half a dot length). If you still tend to generate unwanted dits, increase this value.
- File player can now also play texts that contain pro signs. Pro signs need to be written as two characters (either upper or lower case) within [] or <>. The following pro signs are recognized:
    - <ar> : will be shown on display as +
    - <bt>:  will be shown on display as =
    - <as>
    - <ka>
    - <kn>
    - <sk>
    - <ve>
- New parameter for file player: „Randomize File“. If set to „On“ (default is „Off“), the device will skip n words after each word sent (n = random number between 0 and 255); as file reads wrap around at end-of-file, you will see all the words in the file eventually (but it could take a while). If your file is for example an alphabetical word list, words generated will still be in alphabetical order during one pass of the file; so to get more unpredictable results, it will be best to start with a random list of words. What can this be used for? You could for example take a list of call signs and upload this file to the Morserino-32 (google for supercheckpartial to get files with calls that actually have been active in HF contests). Now File Player lets you train these call signs in a random fashion….
