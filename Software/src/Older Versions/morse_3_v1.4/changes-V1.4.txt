Changes in Version 1.4


Bug fixes:
- Non-squeeze mode did not implement the latency parameter, this has been fixed.

- Parameter „Trainer Disp“ (Display in Generator Mode) did not honor the setting „No Display“, this has been fixed. The parameter is now called „CW Gen Displ“ (as it controls the display of the CW Generator Mode).

Improvements.
- Internal and external paddle do now operate in parallel, without the need to set a parameter to switch between the two.

- Instead of the parameter „Use Ext. Paddle“, which is not used anymore, we have a new parameter „External Pol.“ (Polarity) with two options: „Normal“ and „Reversed“; use the latter if your external paddle is wired „the wrong way“, to make sure the external and the touch paddle have dots and dashes on the same side.

- Non-squeeze mode now also has a dot and dash memory (I.e. while an element is being processed, you can already enter the next element - more likely a bug fix then an improvement);

New Feature:

- New parameter „Echo Prompt“. It defines how you are prompted in Echo Trainer mode. The possible settings are: „Sound only“ (default; the standard behavior in previous versions; best for learning to copy in your head), „Display only“ (the word you are supposed to enter is shown on the screen, no audible code is generated; good for training paddle input), and „Sound & Display“, i.e you hear the prompt AND you can see it on the display.
