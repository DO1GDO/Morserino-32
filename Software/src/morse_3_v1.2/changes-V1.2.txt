What has changed?


Bug fixes and Improvements:

Modified: Volume Control. Depending on the impedance of the headphones used, the volume was generally too loud, even on the lowest setting. This has been modified, so that the lower 4 settings are better suited for headphone use and are significantly lower in volume. Downside is that the quality of the tone at these low volumes ( = amount of harmonics) is different from the higher volume levels.
Minor changes to Iambic B timings in connections with the latency parameter (probably not noticeable - let me know if you detect something unusual or uncomfortable)
New features:

Koch Sequence: the sequence of letters through the Koch lessons the M32 is using is compatible with the program „Just Lean Morse Code“ (JLMC). As some users also train with „Learn CW On-line“ (LCWO), there I now an option in the parameters to use the same sequence with the M32. In both cases there are additional characters at the end, because Morserino-32 teaches you 50 different characters, while LCWO has 41 and JLMC has 44 characters.
Time Out now configurable: There is now a parameter „Time Out“, which can be set to „No Timeout“, „5 min“, „10 min“ or „15 min“. Switching time out off is particularly helpful when running from an external power supply, so that saving battery power is not an issue. 
New parameter „Quick Start“: If you set this parameter to „ON“ (default is „OFF“), the Morserino-32 will immediately execute the modus last selected before shutdown, and will not stay in the menu selection. This is helpful if you normally always start with the same menu selection (e.g. if you always start in modus Echo Trainer, or if you always start in modus CW Keyer).
